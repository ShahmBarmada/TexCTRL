thanks to all the people who built these awesome tools.

This app aims to serve the needs of a textile manufacturing business, where they buy fabrics and turn them into curtains, cushions, carpets, etc.
Like any business nowadays, it needs to track its inventory, purchases, sales, employees, and all the metrics involved within, in order to generate reports and make decisions.

## Business Model Scenario:
There's multiple warehouses, a party of employees with different levels of authority, a pack of vendors, and numerous customers, the selling process goes online and in place, with all the logistics and details related.

The business buys many types of fabrics, which differentiate in thread types, width of the roll, length, price, weight, etc. Then, a mix of these textiles goes along with another bunch of types of different materials to make textiles products such as carpets, cushions, curtains, etc.

During the process of manufacturing, we need to track and measure usage of raw materials and fabrics. how much is used? wasted? turned up faulty and unusable? if there was a gap between the sticker on the fabric roll and the actual length of it!, it all needs to be  recorded, and later analysed, The next step is to sell the products, make invoices, deliver orders, count the register, and check the profits, The full accounting experience.

## Database structure:
.... to be updated.
